## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of the **Digital Humanities initiative** under the interdisciplinary research topic:

> **“Philosophy in Graph: Digital Humanities Journeys through *The Four Books (Tứ Thư)*”**  
> *Master of Interdisciplinary Science – VNUHCM University of Science, 2025*

### 🧭 Research Focus
The project explores how *AI-driven narrative generation* and *multimodal visualization* can support philosophical interpretation and knowledge transmission.  
It demonstrates how classical texts — such as *The Great Learning (Đại Học)*, *The Analects (Luận Ngữ)*, *Mencius (Mạnh Tử)*, and *Doctrine of the Mean (Trung Dung)* — can be computationally modeled and visually reimagined.

### 🧩 Methodological Approach
- **Data Source:** Annotated bilingual corpus extracted from *Lý Minh Tuấn’s Tứ Thư Bình Giải*  
- **Structure:** Each record includes Classical Chinese (C), Hán-Việt transliteration (V), and modern Vietnamese meaning (M)  
- **Knowledge Representation:** A multilayer knowledge graph (16k nodes, 71k edges) connecting semantic, linguistic, and commentary relationships  
- **Generative Extension:** Integration of Gemini + FLUX image synthesis to produce interpretive comic visualizations  

### 💡 Pedagogical Value
This system reimagines traditional moral philosophy through a visual and narrative medium — turning textual commentary into stories that *teach through seeing*.  
It serves both as a **research prototype** for computational humanities and as a **pedagogical experiment** in bridging Confucian philosophy, language technology, and visual storytelling.

🧩 *AI Comics Factory – The Great Learning (大学 / Đại Học)* thus represents a creative intersection between:
- **Textual Scholarship** (classical translation & commentary),
- **Data Science** (graph-based linguistic modeling),
- **Generative AI** (story + image synthesis),
- and **Design Research** (knowledge visualization for education).
